Overview

This project is a backend system for a ride-hailing application similar to Uber, built using Node.js. It features two panels:

User Ride Panel: Allows users to book rides.

Captain Panel: Enables captains (drivers) to manage ride availability.

The backend handles ride requests, driver availability, and real-time ride tracking using an asynchronous and pipelined architecture.

Features

User Authentication: Secure login/signup for users and captains.

Ride Booking: Users can request rides, and nearby captains are assigned dynamically.

Captain Availability Management: Captains can update their availability status.

Real-time Ride Tracking: Tracks rides in progress with live updates.

Payment Integration: Supports payment processing (if applicable).

Asynchronous Processing: Uses event-driven architecture to manage ride requests efficiently.

Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (or another database)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets (or Firebase/Socket.io)

Cloud Services: AWS/GCP (optional, for deployment)
